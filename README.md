# What is this repo about?
I decided to take a refresher course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from [Udemy Online Courses](https://udemy.com "Udemy").
I signed up for [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W9C3@46F2Cg-CyH8CJV6XkcMIvp3Xrly2CTxaO1Z0u7YJqwcervy9D87c-oNXm7oXsdw=/) by [Colt Steel](https://github.com/Colt).
This repository is basically the different projects he has in the course and my solutions to them.

# What's going on?
I took a few years off from the tech scene due to family and military service. We all know how fast technology changes, and just how fast you can get behind the 8-ball if you're
not practising your craft on a daily basis. I obviously retained a lot of my knowledge, but felt I needed to bring myself current and do so as if I'd never worked the industry before.

I love writing code, working on networks, and just about anything linux. There's just something about taking an idea in your mind and making it come into existence in reality, 
or at least digital reality. Sometimes, to break the procrastination bubble, you have to pick a starting point and just get to it.

So, I decided to take a couple refresher courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from [Udemy Online Courses](https://udemy.com "Udemy") to get the mental juices flowing and working again.

# What courses did you sign up for?
One of the courses I signed up for was [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W9C3@46F2Cg-CyH8CJV6XkcMIvp3Xrly2CTxaO1Z0u7YJqwcervy9D87c-oNXm7oXsdw=/) by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/). 
You can find the public repositories for his courses [here](https://github.com/Colt) on GitHub. 

I also signed up for one by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) as well called [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gG3@g4yy_jYaZ22Ef9BQyn5EwKXnfDHWbrBeo6d1KGP9FmZir80WWthpzqHTlE0WRrU=/)

# What is this repository about?
 _This_ repository is basically the different projects Dr. Angela Yu has in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript course I signed up for, and my solutions to them.
They're not fancy, crazy good, or stupendous. They're just good solid answers to the problems she posed for we students to solve. This repository will grow over time
because she offers an assessment and moves the starting goalpost to where your knowledge levels are. I'm backfilling the stuff that assessment moved me past, and the
newer updated stuff she's added to her course.

# Would you recommend these instructors?
Both of these instructors are excellent! I have only taken one of Colt's courses; the one I mentioned above. However, I've taken several of Dr. Angela Yu's courses.

I highly recommend her [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)!
